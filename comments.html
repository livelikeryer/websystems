            <br>
            <p> My overall design was simple and basic as I didn't want to do too much and add too many colours and make it very flashy.</p>
            <h4> Technical Aspects - </h4>
            <br>
            <p>The website comprises four HTML documents, one stylesheet, and multiple image files. When the 'websystems' directory is specified, the web server is configured to access the home page, which is 'index.html'. The structure of my website was </p>

            <p>Overall, the CSS selectors and rules are used to style different elements of the web pages to create a visually appealing and organized layout. Styles are applied to elements like body, header, nav, a, and more to ensure a consistent and cohesive design throughout the website. CSS resets default styles and defines typography, spacing, and colors to enhance readability and aesthetics.</p>
            <h5>Aesthetics - </h5>
            <br>
            <p>The design aims for a professional, clean, and accessible look while maintaining a visually pleasing layout. The color contrast and clear typography choices enhance readability, and the layout ensures that users can easily navigate and consume the content. Overall, it's a balanced design that focuses on both aesthetics and functionality. I wanted a more simple look to the website as I feel like it is visually pleasing and something that isn't too flashy for peoples likings.</p>
       <br>
       <p> I used a combination of contrasting colors to create a visually appealing design. The header and footer have a dark background (#333) to provide contrast with white text for better readability. The body content area has a light background to make the content stand out.</p>
      <br>
       <p>The header section is designed to be bold and eye-catching. It features a dark background color, white text, and centered alignment. The website title and navigation menu are prominent and easy to find.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Paragraphs are styled for improved text readability, with a comfortable line height and spacing. Margins and padding are used to create appropriate spacing around text content.</p>

        <h6>Accessibility - </h6>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
              Semantic HTML elements, such as header, nav, main, and footer, have been used appropriately to provide a meaningful structure to the content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the page's layout and content correctly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              Used a simple colour scheme so people with color blindness don't feel like they are being left out.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              Users won't have any trouble reading the text because the font size has been kept at an adequate size for the screen. Text throughout paragraphs is readable. For the best readability, I left the font at its default setting.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              For the reader to be able to read the content without getting confused, I used appropriate line and letter spacing.
            </li>
